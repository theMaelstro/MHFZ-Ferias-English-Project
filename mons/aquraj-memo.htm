<y1><div>Jebia Part breaks</div>
<p>
Stun value： Does not accumulate while staggering, roaring, falling or flipped.<br>
Stagger value：Does not accumulate while being staggered, Stunned, Falling or Flipped(It does while roaring once)<br>
<br>
・Head, Right Claw, Left Claw<br>
　○When not destroyed, the stagger accumulation of cutting is reduced, and after breaking crystals, the stagger accumulation of Impact is reduced as follows.<br>
　　　Colorless：70％, Yellow：80％, Blue：90％<br>
　○Stagger Value increases by 1.5x when part destroyed once in yellow state.<br>
　　　（If other parts are also destroyed once while yellow the stagger value also rises by 1.5x）<br>
・Tail<br>
　○Cut value accumulates at 40% HP when flipped in blue state.(Amount doesn't reset if it recovers)<br>
　○Stagger accumulation of cutting is reduced by 90% until the accumulated stagger value hits 400<br>
　○Stagger accumulation of impact is reduced by 90% until the accumulated stagger value hits 400<br>
 ○At this point with both cutting and impact the tail should be cut.<br>
　　（Tail can be cut with just one damage type but requires 4400 damage)<br>
</p>
<div>Jebia Hitzone Changes</div>
<p>
Varies depending on broken parts<br>
・Head, Right Claw, Left Claw<br>
　○Undestroyed：First Hitzone<br>
　○One destroyed part, 1st break part hitzone chart<br>
　○2nd stage of part break, 2nd hitzone chart<br>
　○No break flipped：Flipped hitzone chart<br>
・Tail<br>
　○No break flipped：Flipped hitzone chart<br>
　○Totally Broken（400 accum stagger)：1st break part hitzone chart<br>
　○Totally Broken（400 accum stagger)：2nd hitzone chart<br></y1>
