<p>
If you feed one 5-7 pieces of meat colored the same as their saliva, they get fat and flail around.<br>
You can make it vomit in this state by attacking and scaring it.<br>
<br>
White → Raw Meat<br>
Purple → Poisoned Meat<br>
Yellow → Tinged Meat<br>
Light Blue → Drugged Meat<br>
<br>
※Feeding them meat that is not the same color as their saliva will make their bellies fat, but they will vomit less often.<br>
<br>
Lost items spit out in the order of 2 white, 2 green, 2 purple, 2 blue, 9x max.<br>
・If you keep feeding meat that is all the same color as his saliva until he is full, his vomit will start at purple.<br></y1>
